# lmm-chickgrowth

In this R program we explore the ChickWeight dataset and use linear mixed models to explore the underlying relationship between weight growth in chicks with the time since birth and diet.

We also explore the effect of the interaction between time and diet on weight using visualization using ggplot2 library
